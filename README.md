My Game Engine Is a modular system that uses delegates emulating the ones in unreal Engine 
also uses an  Entity Component Sytems that Encapsulates code into components that can be easlily
reusable by other Entitties, for executing actions that require input I use the command pattern which allows me to execute 
Actions either in  a per frame basis or one time
